I have done thorough testing of the server, and all client commands using telnet and giving different test scenarios. Here is a brief description of how I approached the testing:

	* For all eight commands(USER, NICK, QUIT, JOIN, LIST, PART, PRIVMSG, and WHO), I have done extensive test case scenarios to see that I do not miss any possible errors.I have checked against providing minimum number of commands and then ensurinf that ERR_NEEDMOREPARAMS must generate. User is only registered if and only if both NICK and USER commands have been passed. I tested to esure that ERR_INVALID command is generated if user tries to access the other commands such as JOIN before registering itself. I also made sure that for any command other than the 8 defined above, ERR_UNKNOWN COMMAND is displayed. 
	* I have tested that all clients in a channel get the quit message whenver a client does any of the following: 1) client passes the quit command 2) part command 3) Joins another channel 4) client leaves abruptly (without QUIT message). Whenever client leaves abruptly, I test to make sure that he is deleted from the channel list, all other clients on that channel get the message and client's data is deleted from client's array.
	*In order to test for rare instant when a malicious user sends a data string greater than 512 bytes, I cut bytes and only send the first 512 butes to the handle_line and buffer. This avoids the buffer overflow problem.
	*I test extreme cases such as when client calls LIST command when there exist no channels, the client is told that there exist no channels right now. 
	*In order to ensure that PART command accepts multiple arguments, I test that it prints out ERR_NOTONCHANNEL for all the channels clients is not part of and quit message for the one it is part of. I also make sure that appropriate error message is printed out if user tries to PART the channel it is not part of.
	*I tested mutiple times to make sure that whenever user changes NICK, every client on the channel get the message.
	*I test the extreme case when user tries to send privmsg to user or channel that doesn't exist or user is not part of, he gets the errror.

Like these, there are many other cases where I use mutliple tellnet statements to ensure each command is working properly and there is no warning given when compiling the files.
