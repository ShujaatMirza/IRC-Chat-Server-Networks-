Sircd.c contains the code for my socket that accepts, binds and listens for the clients and data concurrently using Select(). When Data arrives, it is passes to the handle_line function in irc_proto.c where it is sent to appropriate command based on the parameters. I use client_array to store all the clients based on their scoket descripter number. I use channel_array to store the names and the number of users in each channel. These structures are defined in sircd.h. KIndly run the make file by passing the make in terminal. Afterwards, use ./sircd 1 node1.conf to run the server. In order to connect clients to this server, use telnet localhost 20102. And this will make our IRC chat server up and going :)
